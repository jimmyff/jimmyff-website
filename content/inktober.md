Inktober is an annual global challenge where loads of people around the world follow a list of daily prompts -one for each day of October. You can interpret the prompt however you like, you're supposed to just use black and white but I go for whatever style I want to practice & explore. I've completed the challenge multiple times now ðŸ˜…! Below are my Inktober artworks over the years.
