S-Bend is a relatively narrow couple of turns that leads on to the bigger Pipe sweeping corner. Depending on the particular boat and weather conditions usually some manual assistance is required to help get it round the first corner which is initiated by the person in bow position (steering) calling harder on stroke side for 2-3 (stroke-side is your right hand oar). If you're on faster piece (usually heading in from the Lock) then navigating the S-bend usually allows for a little respite and breather before you have to get back on the pressure!
