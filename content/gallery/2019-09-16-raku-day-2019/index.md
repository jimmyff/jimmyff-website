Had a great day raku firing! A friend and local potter runs these every year from her garden. Here are my pots:

{{ image(src="top.webp", alt="Top down") }}

This was naked raku, I used blue slip on the inside. I brushed a feather over it to make the dark marks.

{{ image(src="side.webp", alt="Side of pot") }}

I used horse hair on the side to make thee marks.

{{ image(src="glazed.webp", alt="Glazed") }}

I used sunspot glaze on striped areas here and it came out with a wonderful coppery finish.

I also naked raku'ed this small pot but I could have been a bit moreb old with it.

I had great fun loading and unloading the raku kiln!
