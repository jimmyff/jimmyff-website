### Game play ideas

I love the idea that dinosaurs will live in this game. I imagine they'll be like other animals: wild and dangerous but maybe you can tame them. I also have really cool ideas for mounts. I think they'll originate from a jungle realm called The Lost Kingdom, maybe a type of dinosaur has evolved in to a highly intelligent species?
