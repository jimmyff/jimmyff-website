### Here we go again! ...Inktober 2024

So for this years inktober I'm planing to create artworks that I can use in my [Ultimate Quest](/projects/quest/) project. The prompts this year are all adventuring vibes so it actually coincides really nicely!

I had planned to upgrade [Deckorator](/projects/deckorator/) to add SVG support (inspired by my recent work on [Pop Snap](/projects/stickers/)). Then each day I would post a finished game card but time has been stretched recently and I haven't managed to get around to it. I've set myself a challenge to get that tool created by the end of Inktober 2024, -let's see if I manage to make it ...I have some pretty awesome plans! ðŸ‘€
