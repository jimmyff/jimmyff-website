I've been hand finishing my thrown pots by applying texture. It's gives them a really lovely tactile finish.

I used a bright yellow glaze on the inside.

I made this one for my brother and his family as they bought a new house. I etched their initials in to the base then added a black underglaze to make the letters pop.
