After doing a single painting each session of my oil painting course I wanted to see what I could do if I spent longer on a single piece. So for the final 3 sessions of the course I worked on a painting of Neil, if I liked it then I would give him at Christmas. This is the largest painting I've done so far and I really enjoyed working on a bigger scale. It was tight getting it finished in the 3 classes and could have done with an additional hour or two!

Here is a snap of the picture after the first 2 hour session. I started with a pencil sketch and then tried to quickly block some colours in.
