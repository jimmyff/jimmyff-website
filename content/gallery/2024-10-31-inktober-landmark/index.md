### Game play ideas

I think this will be the settlement area of the 'Lost Kingdom' realm. From here you will explore the jungles, encounter the local natives and dinosaurs!

Pheeeeew! ...So this wraps up another year of [Inktober](/inktober/)! This year was a bit of a struggle as I have so much going on with work and personal life but I managed to do it. I felt like I got in to my stride and started really enjoying the last week or so. I might continue doing the odd #Inktober52 prompts (one per week), to keep up the routine and continue creating assets for my passion project [Ultimate Quest](/projects/quest/)!
