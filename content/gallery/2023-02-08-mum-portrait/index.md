I've spent the last 4 sessions at art painting course working on a portrait of my mum. It's her birthday today and I'll give her it tonight. It's another big piece, similar size to the painting I did of Neil just before Christmas. I'm pleased with how this came out, I would have liked another 2 hour session to tidy up some of the areas that I feel a little unresolved but that always seems to be the case with my oil paintings!

Here you can see progress after each session (about 2 hours of painting time).
