These are the Wizards Oracle Binoculars. They allow the bearer to see through doors and walls to spot danger ahead. When used you can draw the next 3 adversary cards and you may banish one to the bottom of the deck (as a way of avoiding it) and place the remaining two back in whatever order you choose!
