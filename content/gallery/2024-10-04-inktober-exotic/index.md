> 🐉 In the depths of the earth, a creature unknown; an exotic beauty, made of crystal and stone...

A stone & crystal dragon/dinosaur living deep under a volcano. This is just a baby that you might encounter and might even be able to train as an ally but their mum is going to be much bigger and grumpier, she'll be the boss of this chapter of the game!
