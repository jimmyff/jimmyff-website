One November Saturday morning I did this Santa drawing with the idea to make our first ever homemade Christmas Cards!

Neil came up with a poem for the inside of the cards.

The hardest bit was I stuck 10 little gem stickers on each of the baubles to give them a bit of sparkle. I ended up sticking over 1000 gems on with tweasers! 😅

We chose to support two very deserving charities: [Mermaids](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/) & [UK black pride](https://www.ukblackpride.org.uk/).
