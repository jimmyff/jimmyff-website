I hadn't planned to do Christmas cards again this year, with the launch of my new app I've had little time for anything else. Anyway, I threw together this card rather hastily after snapping a fun photo of Elphie hanging out of hed bed upside down. Once the cards had been delivered it became clear that the graphic was a little confusing with my mums first reaction was to turn the card upside down!

I added a large gold craft gem to the three yellow lights on the card to add a little sparkle. Neil came up with a lovely poem for the inside of the cards.
