...Here we go again! It's almost #inktober season. This year I'm trying something a little different by having a single image that I'll be adding to each day. I've quite a lot of commitments this year so my time will be pretty limited. I'm also using it as an excuse to have a try an app called 'Concepts' - this differs from the art apps I've used before as it uses something called 'Vector Graphics' which means each stroke and mark is stored as code rather than modifying pixels. I've no idea how this is going to turn out! ðŸ˜…

Who else is taking on the challenge this year? ðŸŽ¨
