I've decided to have a go at illustrating a map of Leeds canal for rowers. It will go from Leeds Rowing Clubs boathouse down to the lock which is around 4.2km away. It'll feature 9 landmarks along the way.

The first landmark will the be the boathouse itself, the next is 200m away and that's the Red Bridge. On a foggy day you need to be able to see this bridge from the pontoon. At this point in an outing your usually doing warm up drills.
