I love going past boats, in autumn and winter you can often smell the log fires burning and a low mist clings to the water. The boats are moored outside the now disused Thwaite Mill and the surrounding foliage is particular luscious. We pass quietly so not to disturb the residents and on our way back in usually you can smell the coffee brewing and fresh bacon sandwiches!
