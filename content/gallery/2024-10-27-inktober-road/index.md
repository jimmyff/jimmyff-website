### Game play ideas

The game will be split in to locations, each will have a campaign sheet, an adventure book and cards you add to the game when you access the location. You will start the game at 'Home Town', it will be a little town that you will gradually level up, as you complete quests you will unlock more market stalls. Home Town will be a little safe heaven for you to go off adventuring and discovering the more exotic realms. This is an image of what the town might look like.
