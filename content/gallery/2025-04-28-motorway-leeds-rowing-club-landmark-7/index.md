Motorway is a wide stretch of the canal, it can be quite blustery and the water can be pretty choppy here. By this point you're probably tiring a little after doing your first proper piece of rowing through S-bend and pipe, with your heart racing and a face full of canal water combined with the thundering of vehicles overhead can be pretty exciting. If there's ever a flash thunderstorm and you're at the bottom of the canal this is where you need to hide until it passes - lightening and wet carbon fibre boats don't mix well!
