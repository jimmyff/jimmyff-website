Welcome and hello! [I'm Jimmy](/series/self-portraits), a 90's teen that never really grew up. I'm an avid gamer and an obsessive creator. Befitting my favorite era, this is my little den on the internet (don't forget to sign my [guestbook](/guestbook) ;). Herein you will find some of my projects and a bit of an insight in to my scatterbrain (checkout [my blog](/blog/)). If you would like to contact me then [send me a message](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIN2i8tudYfvWZO96Ed-_ma011PgZU-CrxRyCXdSA1z9NRjA/viewform).

## Analogue & digital gaming

I tend to find non-interactive things boring after a short-time, this is perhaps why I consider gaming one of my cornerstones. I love analogue gaming as a way of gathering friends and family around a table and having a great evening. I've dabbled in both [analogue game design](/tags/gamedev-analogue/) and [video game development](/tags/gamedev-digital). I'm a passionate gamer and a self-confessed [Nintendo](/tags/nintendo) fan-boy. I love boardsgames and enjoy RPG's too, feel free to [connect on BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/jimmyff).

## Coding & technology

You can find my public work over on my [Github profile](https://github.com/jimmyff/). I'm always creating something new! My main language is [Dart](/tags/lang-dart), I'm in love with the Flutter framework. I'm also trying to level up my [Rust](/tags/lang-rust) skills. I'm a big fan of serveless technology and my preferred backend is Google Cloud.

## Creative arts

I always some creative endeavour on the go, you can check out the [gallery](/gallery) to see some of the things I've made. Some of the mediums include getting messy with clay doing [ceramics](/medium/ceramic/), playing around with my tablet creating [digital art](/medium/digital/) and making a mess with [oil paints](/medium/oil/). I also enjoy to practice yoga.
