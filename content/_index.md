# Welcome! 👋

Hello & welcome! [I'm Jimmy](/series/self-portraits), a 90's teen that never really grew up. I'm an [obsessive creator](/projects/), an [avid gamer](/games/), [dedicated rower](/tags/rowing/), and a fun loving [dog dad](/tags/elphaba/). Befitting my favorite era, this is my little den on the internet (don't forget to sign my [guestbook](/guestbook/) ;). Herein you will find some of my projects and a bit of an insight in to my scatterbrain (_[see blog](/blog/)_). This website is first and foremost for me, it serves as a little diary which gives me a bit of record of the stuff I was up to many moons ago!

## Analogue & digital gaming

Gaming is one of my cornerstones, probably as I find non-interactive activities pretty boring! I love [table top gaming](/games/) as a way of gathering friends and family around a table and having a great joint experience (feel free to [connect on BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/jimmyff)). I love to [design board games](/tags/tabletop-game-design/) and I've dabbled with [video game development](/tags/gamedev-digital) too. I'm a passionate gamer although I don't get much time for video games these days but I remain a die hard [Nintendo](/tags/nintendo) fan-boy.

## Coding & technology

You can find my public projects over on my [Github profile](https://github.com/jimmyff/). I'm always creating something new! My main language is [Dart](/tags/lang-dart), I'm in love with the Flutter framework. I'm also trying to level up my [Rust](/tags/lang-rust) skills. I'm a big fan of serverless technology and my preferred backend is Google Cloud. Oh and I use [Nix](/tags/nix/) btw ([my nixfiles](https://github.com/jimmyff/nixfiles)).

## Creative arts

I always have some creative endeavour on the go, you can check out the [gallery](/gallery/) to see some of the things I've made. Some of the mediums include getting messy with clay doing [ceramics](/medium/ceramic/), playing around with my tablet creating [digital art](/medium/digital/) and making a mess with [oil paints](/medium/oil/). I also enjoy to practice yoga and I usually get involved with the [Inktober](/inktober/) challenge!

## My work & apps

I run a small independant company called Rocketware. Head over to the [apps](/apps/) page for more information!

## About this site

This site has been lovingly created in markdown and generated by [Zola](https://getzola.org/) -a wonderfully simple Rust based static site generator. I've published my theme [Zap](https://github.com/jimmyff/zola-zap) over on GitHub. The site is also hosted on Github pages and generated in a Github action.
