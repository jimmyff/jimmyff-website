I run a very small company called Rocketware. I set the company up back in 2011. The company works full-time on our own apps, it would be a great help to me if you were to be kind enough to give them a review!

## One Scene

An modern inclusive dating app. This is my latest project, it's a reimagining of the dating product I launched back in 2011. I launched this app in December 2022 and it continues to be my main focus as I work to get it established.

## Sticker Party

I created this app originally in 5 days as a bit of a challenge for myself. It's now a lovely little photo editor allowing you add stickers to your photos. The stickers are all vector files so the look awesome no matter how zoomed in you go. To find out more see [related blog posts](/tags/stickerapp).

## ESC Party

This is an unofficial fan-app dedicated to the Eurovision Song Contest. This app has been a labour of love, it's probably the most comprehensive resource of Eurovision data in a single app. It features every Eurovision Song Contest since 1956, videos of every entry, photos of many of the performances and artists, results, scorecards and various details about the locations, participants, performers and more. To find out more see my [Eurovision related blog posts](/tags/eurovision).
