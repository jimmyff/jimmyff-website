_I created a text animation for my [Kosmos app](/projects/cosmic/), I wanted a typewritter style effect that could correct itself in realtime -Ã  la Matrix. It would work well as the user interacts with the astrology charts. The retro-futuristic style fits really well with the vibe of my app and it's become part of it's identity. I figured I'd package it up so other people can use it too! So Clackety is available now over on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/clackety) and the sourcecode is [on Github](https://github.com/jimmyff/clackety)._

...Happy Clacking!

_P.s: If you haven't tried Kosmos yet and haven't seen Clackety in action, then what are you waiting for? You're literally one tap away from the [web app](https://app.kosmos.space)!_
