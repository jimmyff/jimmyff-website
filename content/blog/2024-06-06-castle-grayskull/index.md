I've been getting super nostalgic for Masters of the Universe recently after pledging for a big skirmish game on crowd funding (Clash of Eternia). I adore a skirmish games (War Cry being my favorite) and this colourful and camp universe is so much more appealing to me than Warhammer's Grimdark. To scratch the itch of my excitement I've re-watched all of the tv series, bought the comics collection and huuuge encyclopedia. I also bought this very cool dice tower for a different MoTU skirmish game which I figured I could use with my game when it eventually arrives:

The dice tower arrived in a few big grey plastic sprues and I glued it all together pretty badly as this left lots of gaps for me to fill with green stuff. I undercoated the whole thing in alien purple and went for a nice contrasty green to make it all pop!

I think it came out great. Can't wait for the game to arrive now!
