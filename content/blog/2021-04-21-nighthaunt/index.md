Recently I've been a little obsessed with the Warcry tabletop skirmish game by Games workshop. I picked it up during lock-down and fell it love with it's fast & flowing pace and it's simple rules. For my Nighthaunt warband I wanted a quick to paint yet striking theme so decided to go for an etherial bluey-green colour for the ghosts and high contrast purple bases. I think it gives the warband striking retro-futuristic / vaporwave vibes!
