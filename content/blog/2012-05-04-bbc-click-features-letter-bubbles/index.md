When I got back from a two week holiday in Cuba I noticed a big spike of traffic to my [Letter Bubbles game](/blog/letter-bubbles-typing-game) coming from the BBC Click website. It turns out they featured my game in an educational edition of webscape! The show was broadcast on May 4th 2012.

As a big fan and regular viewer of BBC Click it's great to see my game on the show. Luckily I have it series linked so was able to watch on the big screen via my Sky+. Head over to the BBC Click archive to [view the episode](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9718549.stm) and jump to 2:45 to get straight to LetterBubbles. A huge thanks to [Kate Russell](http://twitter.com/katerussell) (pictured) for the great feature.
